# SSOProxy
CONIKS single sign on proxy. There are two main contributions of this proxy:

- Create a proof-of-concept single sign on system that supports both old school user registration/login and authentication via social network API. 
- Back-end server seamlessly integrates with CONIKS server using a TLS socket to perform LOOKUP for user's key and proof of inclusion/integrity.
